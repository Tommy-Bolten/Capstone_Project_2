Summary:
This project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry, where customer retention is crucial for profitability. Using machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), the project aimed to identify customers likely to churn based on their demographics, account details, and usage patterns.

Process:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features where needed.
Model Development: Developed three modelsâ€”Logistic Regression (accuracy: 79%), Random Forest (accuracy: 80%), and SVC (accuracy: 79%).
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models based on accuracy, with the Random Forest model achieving the highest accuracy and providing valuable interpretability into churn-related features.

Results:
The Random Forest model was the top performer, with 80% accuracy, highlighting key factors influencing churn, such as tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. Recommendations include targeting at-risk customers with personalized retention strategies and focusing on areas like high charges and short tenure to enhance customer experience. Further research could involve exploring deep learning or advanced ensemble methods to improve predictive accuracy.
